This README is intended to guide users through the setup process for running the Stylita app. The repository contains both the client and the server components of the application.

We’ll start by setting up the client. The client is built using Expo and requires either the Expo Go app or an Android/iOS simulator to view the app during development. Once you've cloned the repository from GitHub, navigate to the client directory by running **cd client**. Next, install all the required dependencies using the command **npm install --legacy-peer-deps**. After the installation is complete, start the development server by running npx expo start. This will display a QR code on your terminal screen. Expo Go users can scan this QR code to launch the app on their device, while simulator users can press the appropriate key indicated in the terminal.

With the client up and running, let's move on to setting up the server. Navigate to the server folder using **cd server**. To avoid installing packages globally and to keep the environment clean, it's best to create a virtual environment. You can do this by running **python -m venv your_venv_name**. Once created, activate the virtual environment using **your_venv_name\Scripts\activate** on Windows or **source your_venv_name/bin/activate** on Linux/macOS. After activation, your terminal prompt will reflect the active virtual environment. Now, install all necessary packages by running **pip install -r requirements.txt**.

Before running the server, you may need to make necessary configuration changes in the settings.py file located in the server folder. Once configured, start the server using the command **python manage.py runserver**.

To enable communication between the Expo app and the Django server — especially since they might run on different devices or networks — we cannot use localhost directly. Instead, we use Ngrok, which serves as a secure tunnel to forward client requests to the server. First, install Ngrok using **npm i ngrok**, and create a free account at ngrok.com. Follow the authentication steps provided on the site. Once authenticated, start Ngrok with the command **ngrok http your_local_ip**, replacing your_local_ip with the IP address on which your server is running. Ngrok will provide a public URL which you need to add to the **ALLOWED_HOSTS** list in your server’s settings.py file. Additionally, update the **API_URL** in the client code by modifying **client/utils/axiosInstance.ts** with the new Ngrok URL.

After completing all these steps, you should be able to successfully run and test the Stylita app with the client and server communicating seamlessly.
